Two-Player Dice Rolling Game in C
Problem Statement

Design and implement a C program for a two-player dice rolling game with the following rules:

The game consists of two players: Player 1 and Player 2.

The game starts with Player 1.

A dice roll generates a random number between 1 and 6.

Player 1 keeps rolling the dice and accumulating the score until the dice shows the number 1.

When the dice shows 1:

Player 1's turn immediately ends.

The total score accumulated by Player 1 is calculated and stored.

After Player 1's turn ends, Player 2 starts playing.

Player 2 follows the same rules:

Keeps rolling the dice.

Accumulates the score.

Stops when the dice shows 1.

After both players have completed their turns:

Compare the total scores of Player 1 and Player 2.

If Player 1's score is higher, Player 1 wins.

Otherwise, Player 2 wins.

Requirements

Use loops (while or do-while) to simulate continuous dice rolling.

Use conditional statements (if-else) to control game flow.

Use the rand() function to simulate dice rolls.

Use appropriate variables to store scores.

Display each dice roll and current score during gameplay.

Display the final scores and declare the winner at the end.

Constraints

The dice must generate values only between 1 and 6.

The game must end immediately when a player rolls a 1.

The program should be well-structured and properly commented.




//for result you just have to divide score/turn and check which has result more that player is winner
